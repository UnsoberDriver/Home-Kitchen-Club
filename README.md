# Home Kitchen Club

A recipe site I coded in pure PHP to improve my web dev skills (no framework, I wanted to understand what's happening under the hood). There's a public area to browse recipes, an account system, and an admin dashboard to manage everything.

## What it does

* Recipe list filterable by category, with a detailed page per recipe (ingredients, steps, time, difficulty)
* Live serving adjustment on the recipe page (quantities recalculated in JS)
* User accounts: sign up / log in, with a "stay logged in" option (remember-me secured by token)
* Admin dashboard to create, edit, and delete recipes
* Image upload, automatically converted to AVIF + thumbnail generation
* Contact form in a popup (AJAX, protected by a CSRF token)
* Bilingual FR/EN site, auto-detected based on browser language

## Stack

Native PHP, MySQL/PDO, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. No framework, no build tool. Images go through GD for AVIF conversion (requires PHP 8.1+).

## Security

A few things I put in place while learning about the topic:

* Passwords hashed with `password_hash` / `password_verify`
* Prepared SQL statements (PDO) everywhere, no query concatenation
* CSRF protection on sensitive forms (contact, recipe creation/editing)
* "Remember me" cookie based on a hashed selector/validator pair (no plaintext token stored server-side), rotated on every use

## Internationalization

The site detects the browser language on first load and displays content in French or English accordingly. The logic lives in `lang.php`, static text is in `fr.php` / `en.php`, and recipes have `_en` columns in the database with automatic fallback to French if the translation hasn't been filled in yet.
